This is the Folder that the raw survey data will be placed into after running the "Download_x.R" scripts for each region

The ai_strata.csv, ebs_strata.csv, and goa_strata.csv are static and do not change from year to year. 

The West Coast Triennial (wctri) is not longer run and is not updated. Therefore these files also do not change year to year, and will be what is used for the wctri analysis. Do not delete these files.
