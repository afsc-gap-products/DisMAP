# The Distribution Mapping and Analysis Portal (DisMAP)
The NOAA Fisheries Distribution Mapping and Analysis Portal (DisMAP) provides easy access to information to track and understand distributions of marine fish and macroinvertebrate species in the U.S. Marine Ecosystems. The portal currently provides access to distribution information for over 800 species collected in fishery-independent bottom trawl surveys conducted by NOAA Fisheries or its partners. The portal provides information on three key indicators used to track and explore shifts in species distributions:
  * Distribution of biomass in space and time (i.e., distribution surface)
  * Center of biomass
  * Range limits

This repository provides the data processing and analysis code used to develop the spatial distribution and indicators presented in the portal.
